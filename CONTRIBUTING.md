## Ground Rules (Lightweight)
- Be respectful and constructive.
- Prefer incremental, well-scoped changes.
- Keep user credentials and API keys out of code and logs.

---

## Development Setup (Quick)
1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/short-description`
3. Install deps and run locally (see README).
4. Commit with clear messages:  
   - `feat: add websocket reconnect logic`  
   - `fix: handle empty audio frames`  
   - `docs: clarify env setup`

---

## Pull Request Process (Approval Required)
1. **Open a PR** from your fork/branch.
2. **Describe the change**: what/why, screenshots or logs if relevant.
3. **Checklist:**
   - [ ] Small, focused diff
   - [ ] Tests or manual steps included (if applicable)
   - [ ] Docs/README updated (if behavior changes)
4. I will review. **No PR will be merged without approval.**
5. I may push small follow-ups for consistency (naming, docs, formatting).

> Direct pushes to the default branch are not allowed. All changes flow through PRs.

---

## Coding Style (Keep It Simple)
- Follow existing patterns; when in doubt, match nearby code.
- Run formatters/linters if configured (e.g., `prettier`, `ruff`, `black`, `eslint`).
